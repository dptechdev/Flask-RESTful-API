Check into using request parser for grabbing json.
Work on grabbing customer by ID.
Work on why customer_client won't freaking work right.
Refactor into modules - models, resources, db, etc.,
Write unit tests.
Write blog post.
Work on getting 'id' in the right order from the output.
Take a look at that to_json @property or maybe consider
using the @marshal_whatever decorator that comes with 
Flask-RESTful.

Also having the output have a named root like "customers" was just because 
you were going to use Ember Data in the original project .. but this project
isn't using Ember yet. Not for the sake of this exact tutorial. So
output however.
